368,"7. Figures for non-melanoma skin cancer (C44) in 2013 are not reliable figures because at the time of this publication only about half of non melanoma skin registrations for 2013 had been finalised.  This was due to a delay in processing these cases because of the migration to one National Cancer Registration Service. This results in a large decrease in the number of registrations reported in 2013 compared to previous years, and is not an accurate measure of the number of non melanoma skin cancers diagnosed in 2013.  We do not recommend using the 2013 estimates in any analysis. Cells containing C44 counts have been marked with a (u) in the table to indicate unreliability.  We have published these figures because registration of all other cancer sites was completed and we did not wish to delay the publication of the national statistics, nor significantly change the publication format or cause confusion by removing the non melanoma skins completely.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

371,         Rates calculated from fewer than 20 counts may have low reliability and are therefore marked by (u). ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
